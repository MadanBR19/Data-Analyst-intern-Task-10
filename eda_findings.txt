Dataset contains both numerical and categorical features.

Missing values observed in some columns; percentage calculated for cleaning decisions.

Several numeric columns showed right-skewed distributions.

Boxplots revealed presence of extreme values.

Outliers detected using IQR method.

Instead of removing rows, outliers were capped to preserve data volume.

Correlation analysis showed strong relationships between key numeric variables.

Some variables showed weak or no correlation.

EDA helps understand structure before modeling.
